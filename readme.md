# why?

1. because i wanna learn pytorch and how its implemeneted
2. don't wanna use python, i wanna use go

# roadmap

- implement barebones tensor lib similar to pytorch
- broadcasting? or maybe just stick with requiring they're the same shape right now?
- ability to load data into a dataframe
- activation functions (relu, etc)
