# why?

1. because i wanna learn pytorch and how its implemeneted
2. don't wanna use python, i wanna use go

# roadmap

- ~~Tensor Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,~~ and more advanced operations like dot products, transposition, and reshaping.

- Automatic Differentiation: basic version of autograd (forward & back propogation)

- Neural Network Layers: some sort of basic neural network layers (fully connected (dense) layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers)

- ~~Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.~~

- Loss Functions: mean squared error (MSE), cross-entropy, and binary cross-entropy

- Optimizers: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop

- Data Handling: loading, save, batching

- Model Definition and Training Loop: A framework to define models, compile them with loss functions and optimizers, and a training loop to fit models to data.

- GPU Support ???????

- Serialization: saving and loading models and their weights.
