# why?

1. because i wanna learn pytorch and how its implemeneted
2. don't wanna use python, i wanna use go
3. i think go is a better runtime for this anyways since it has static typing and native concurrency

# roadmap

- implement barebones tensor lib similar to pytorch
- implement tensor package, create, update, add, substract, multiply, divide
- broadcasting? or maybe just stick with requiring they're the same shape right now?
- ability to load data into a dataframe
- activation functions (relu, etc)
