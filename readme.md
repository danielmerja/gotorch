# roadmap

1. implement barebones tensor lib similar to pytorch
2. implement tensor package, create, update, add, substract, multiply, divide
3. ability to load data into a dataframe
4. activation functions (relu)

# why?

1. because i wanna learn pytorch and how its implemeneted
2. there's nothing like this for go today and it would be nice instead of h avign to stand up a python service
3. i think go is a better runtime for this anyways since it has static typing, is compiled and has concurrency
